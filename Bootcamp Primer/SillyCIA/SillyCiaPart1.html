<h1>CIA Realizes It's Been Using Black Highlighters All These Years</h1>

<h2>Director Demands Investigation </h2>

<p>LANGLEY, VA—A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed 
    that the CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence 
    information with black highlighters.</br></br>

    According to the report, sections of the documents— "almost invariably the most crucial 
    passages"—are marred by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, 
    due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947.</br></br>
    
    CIA Director <b>Porter Goss</b>lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the 
    particulars of several historic events, such as: </br></br>

    <ul>
        <li>the Cold Warffee</li>
        <li>the civil-rights movement</li>
        <li>the growth of the international drug trade</li>
      </ul>
