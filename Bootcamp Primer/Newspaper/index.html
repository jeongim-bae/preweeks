        <h1>Coronavirus: the situation in Switzerland</h1>

        <p> Switzerland is one of the dozen countries most affected by the coronavirus worldwide, with more than 200 current cases and one confirmed death. Here is an overview of the situation and official response.

            What’s the current situation in Switzerland?
        </h2>
        <p>On Friday the government announced a shift of focus to protect the old and the unwell. </p>

            Figures also rose on Friday, with the Federal Office of Public Health saying there were 210 diagnosed cases. On Thursday, aggregated figures from federal and cantonal authorities showed over 100 positive cases of coronavirus throughout the country. Authorities in canton Vaud also confirmed that a 74-year-old woman, who had been hospitalised in Lausanne, <a href="https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_first-coronavirus-death-recorded-in-switzerland/45597610"> had died as a result of the disease</a> – the first casualty in the country.
        </p>
        <p>
            Discrepancies in reported cases can arise because federal authorities report the number of cases that tested positive at a central lab in Geneva, while cases reported by the cantons have not necessarily been confirmed by the central lab.

            “The situation is serious and becoming more so, but there is no reason to panic,” Daniel Koch of the health office told a news conference in Bern on Wednesday.

            Due to the spread of the coronavirus, the government has categorised the situation in the country as “special”, under the terms of the Epidemics Act. This allows the authorities to take over certain powers from the 26 cantons and to order measures, including bans on events. The application of these legal provisions is a first for Switzerland.

        What’s the risk of becoming infected with the new coronavirus in Switzerland? 
       </h2>
       <p>
        Meanwhile, the risk of contracting the new coronavirus in Switzerland is currently moderate, according to the <a href="https://www.bag.admin.ch/bag/en/home/krankheiten/ausbrueche-epidemien-pandemien/aktuelle-ausbrueche-epidemien/novel-cov.html"> Health Office </a>
       </p>
       <p> 
        However, the number of cases still puts Switzerland among the dozen countries most affected by Covid-19 globally. Current figures from around the world can be <a href="https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6">found here</a>.

        Advice regarding the usage of hankies and the practice of handshakes was published in all major newspapers.

        In order to prevent the spread of the virus as much as possible, those affected have been isolated. Anyone who has been in close contact with a sick person, i.e. less than two metres away for more than 15 minutes, must also remain in quarantine for two weeks. 
       </p>
       <p>
        Authorities also recommend a certain amount of “social distancing” – that is, when standing in a queue, for example, or attending a meeting, to keep a certain distance away from those around you.
       </p>
       <p>
        Recommendations for the world of work have also been issued, such as not travelling at peak commuting times and being able to work from home when possible.
       </p>
       <p>
        Those worried about a possible case are advised to phone the doctor’s office first rather than showing up in person. The cost of a test (CHF180) will be reimbursed by basic health insurance as of Wednesday March 4, the health office announced.
