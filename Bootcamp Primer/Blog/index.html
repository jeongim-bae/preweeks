            <p>Yesterday, I worked quite a while on the assignment Newsies, but I changed most of them today. </p> 
            <p>With modifying a lot, I was getting used to handling CSS properties such as font-family, font size, color, padding, margin and display. 
            </p><p>This assignment was quite challenging for me but I was satisfied after completing this task.

        <p>Setting up computer is fun!</p>
        <p>My main task was to setting my computer up. Two browsers were already installed in my computer, so I skipped that step and installed Visual Studio Code with all necessary extensions.
        </p>
        <p>The beginner level of typing was continued from yesterday and completed today. I started to dig into the coding bootcamp primer and accomplished 10 lessons. It gave me an overview of html.

            <p>I started to set up email, slack and then went through the manual regarding how to set up the free blog. Finally I could set up the netlify and was able to post a blog.
